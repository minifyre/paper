ideas to evaluate
	change server scripts to use the paper.logic.js naming scheme
	have logic require util & export it up the chain but don't include it in input.js' export
	Node.js to Deno (waiting on deno to become stable)
		replace module.exports with export statements
		replace require(path) with import statements
		rename 'node_modules' to 'shared'
